Matching only digits
\d - matches any digit

However, \D matches any non-digit character
\D - 	Any Non-digit character

 . - matches any character
 In order to match dot (.) we can use escaping characters like: \.
 \. - matches only dots

 Excluding specific characters
 We can exclude some specific characters using ^ (hat)
  ^ - excludes characters
  EX: [^abc] will match any single character except for the letters a, b, or c.

We use - (dash) to indicate a character range.
the pattern [0-6] will only match any single digit character from zero to six,
and nothing else. And likewise,
[^n-p] will only match any single character except for letters n to p.


{m} - m Repetitions
{m,n} - m to n Repetitions
w{3} - will match 3 repeated "w"s

Task	Text

Match	aabbbbc	To be completed
Match	aacc	To be completed

Optional characters

? (question mark) denotes optionality.
? - allows you to match either zero or one of the preceding character or group.
For example, the pattern ab?c will match either the strings "abc" or "ac" because the b is considered optional.
